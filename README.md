# SQL-Queries
Advanced SQL queries, including joins, CTEs, window functions, and data transformation techniques to build and manage cloud data warehouses. The project focuses on creating, optimizing, and querying data warehouses using cloud platforms, along with automating steps in a data pipeline. 

---
## Objectives

- Build and optimize cloud data warehouses using SQL queries and advanced techniques.
- Construct complex SQL queries, such as joins, CTEs, and window functions, to analyze and manipulate large datasets.
- Use cloud-based platforms (like Snowflake, AWS Redshift, etc.) to store, manage, and process data effectively.
- Automate data pipeline steps and deliver insights from business-critical datasets to inform decision-making processes.

## Key Outcomes

- **Advanced SQL Querying**: Successfully implemented complex queries including data joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregations for efficient data analysis.
- **Cloud Data Warehouse Setup**: Built cloud data warehouses and data staging areas using SQL commands and cloud integrations.
- **Optimized Data Loading**: Utilized `COPY INTO` commands and staged data efficiently to ensure quick and seamless data loading.
- **Data Transformation**: Applied SQL transformations to clean, manipulate, and load semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, CSV) into structured tables.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Automated steps in the data pipeline, reducing manual effort and ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
